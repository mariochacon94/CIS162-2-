<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Mario Chacon, I am striving to earn my certificate in 
   cybersecurity and cloud computing at Cerritos College. I am a father
    to my 10 year old daughter who is truly my pride and joy. This class
     is somewhat nostalgic, as it reminds me of using Myspace and creating 
     my profile. Currently I work in the restaurant industry as a Food and 
     Beverage manager which has treated me well. Computer science is an intriguing
      topic that I look forward to immersing myself in.  </p>
